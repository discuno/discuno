High-impact mentorship programs live or die on the details—matching the right people, automating busywork, and proving measurable outcomes. Generic scheduling tools were built for quick meetings, not longitudinal coaching relationships. Discuno closes that gap with a stack engineered for universities, accelerators, and workforce programs that need accountable mentoring at scale.

## Where Generic Scheduling Apps Fall Short

- **Fragmented onboarding:** Traditional tools force mentors to juggle multiple logins, manual intake forms, and brittle spreadsheet exports.
- **No revenue controls:** Upgrades and invoicing lag behind real-world mentorship pricing models, making it hard to charge per session or package.
- **Zero context:** Meetings happen, but there’s no canonical record of goals, feedback, or follow-up actions.
- **Limited automation:** Webhooks are brittle, data collection is shallow, and reporting requires downstream scripts or copy/paste.
- **Compliance gaps:** Platforms built for coffee chats rarely handle FERPA, SOC2, or payout regulations.

## Discuno’s Mentorship-First Platform

Discuno combines scheduling, payments, analytics, and credentialing into one mentorship-native workflow:

1. **Cal.com orchestration** keeps availability, buffers, and program rules in sync so mentees always see the right mentor at the right time.
2. **Stripe Connect automations** handle platform fees, delayed transfers, and refunds while keeping the business compliant in every state.
3. **Drizzle-backed data model** maintains a single source of truth for mentor bios, areas of expertise, and booking histories that power better matches over time.
4. **PostHog analytics** ship actionable insights—conversion funnels, drop-off points, and engagement scoring—to your operations team.
5. **Better-auth security** keeps sign-ins, verification, and domain-restricted onboarding safe without adding friction.

## The Experience Your Mentors Deserve

- **Unified dashboard:** Mentors confirm bookings, view mentee prep notes, and update availability without switching tabs.
- **Automated reminders:** Email and SMS nudges reduce no-shows and capture end-of-session feedback.
- **Transparent payouts:** Stripe dashboards expose transfer timelines, taxes, and supporting documents—critical for professional mentors and advisors.
- **Flexible packaging:** Offer paid consultations, subscription hours, or grant-funded sessions with clear eligibility rules.

## Proving ROI With Real Analytics

- Track conversion from application → onboarding → first booking with PostHog dashboards.
- Use Discuno’s ranking algorithms to surface mentors with the highest satisfaction scores for high-priority mentees.
- Export clean datasets for board reports or accreditation reviews—no manual CSV wrangling required.

## Implementation Blueprint

1. **Import your mentors:** Bulk-load spreadsheets or sync directly from your HRIS using Discuno scripts.
2. **Configure programs:** Define coaching tracks, eligibility rules, and session lengths inside the admin console.
3. **Connect payments:** Link Stripe Connect to collect fees, fund scholarships, or pay mentors automatically after the dispute window.
4. **Launch onboarding flows:** Invite mentors and mentees with tailored email sequences and application forms.
5. **Monitor and iterate:** Review PostHog funnels weekly, adjust ranking rules, and push updates without downtime.
