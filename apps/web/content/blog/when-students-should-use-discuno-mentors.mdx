Every student has questions that Google can’t answer. Discuno connects you with vetted mentors—alumni, professionals, and peer leaders—who share context-rich advice exactly when you need it. Here are five moments when scheduling time with a Discuno mentor makes the difference between guessing and moving forward with confidence.

## 1. Choosing the Right School or Program

- Compare campus cultures before you commit.
- Understand academic requirements that matter beyond the brochure.
- Get real talk on scholarships, support services, and hidden costs.

**Try this:** Ask a Discuno mentor who studied your intended major, “What do students wish they knew before saying yes?”

## 2. Surviving First-Year Orientation

- Build a game plan for class registration, roommate expectations, and must-attend events.
- Learn how to navigate campus logistics while still enjoying the hype.

**Try this:** Request a session titled “Orientation playbook for first-year students” and bring your schedule draft for feedback.

## 3. Landing Internships and Research Opportunities

- Workshop your resume, LinkedIn, or portfolio with someone hiring in your field.
- Map internship timelines so you submit applications ahead of the crowd.

**Try this:** Match with a mentor working in your dream company and role-play a behavioral interview.

## 4. Pivoting Majors or Career Paths

- Evaluate academic requirements, graduation timelines, and financial aid implications.
- Hear from mentors who made similar pivots and learn what they would repeat—or skip.

**Try this:** Ask, “If you switched from biology to data science, what courses and clubs gave you a head start?”

## 5. Preparing for Graduation and Life After College

- Build a transition plan that covers job hunting, graduate school, or gap year logistics.
- Get money-smart insights on relocating, negotiating offers, and building your network.

**Try this:** Schedule a “Senior year strategy” session and review multiple offer scenarios with a mentor who has been there.

## Why Discuno Works
