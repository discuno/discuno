Being the first in your family to attend college is a powerful milestone—and it comes with unanswered questions about applications, finances, and fitting in. Discuno connects first-generation students with mentors who have walked the same path, so you gain clarity before deadlines hit. Use this guide to understand how Discuno turns mentorship into a reliable support system.

## The First-Gen Challenge

- **Information gaps:** Admissions jargon, FAFSA requirements, and scholarship criteria can feel inaccessible.
- **Limited networks:** Without family alumni connections, it’s hard to find someone who “gets it.”
- **Financial pressure:** Balancing part-time work, tuition conversations, and budgeting requires a trusted coach.
- **Confidence hurdles:** Imposter syndrome and campus navigation can slow your momentum.

Discuno was built to close those gaps with real human guidance.

## Match with Mentors Who Understand

- Filter for Discuno mentors who identify as first-generation, share your cultural background, or attended your target colleges.
- Review mentor bios to see their major, career path, and the questions they love answering.
- Choose mentors available for ongoing check-ins, not just one-off chats.

## Critical Conversations to Schedule

### Admissions & Applications

- Timeline planning for early action vs. regular decision
- Essay feedback that highlights your story, not clichés
- Understanding what admissions officers look for beyond GPA

### Financial Aid & Scholarships

- Completing FAFSA, CSS Profile, and state-specific forms
- Finding local scholarships and negotiating award letters
- Budgeting for books, housing, and hidden campus fees

### Campus Life & Belonging

- Navigating orientation when you feel like the only “newcomer”
- Finding peer support groups, cultural centers, and mentorship programs
- Balancing academics with family responsibilities back home

## Discuno Tools That Make It Easier

- **Cal.com scheduling:** Book mentor meetings around school, work, or family commitments.
- **Automated reminders:** Stay on top of tasks like deposit deadlines and scholarship applications.
- **Secure notes:** Keep action steps and resources from each mentor session organized in one place.
- **PostHog insights:** Discuno tracks your progress so you can celebrate wins and spot blockers quickly.

## Action Plan for First-Gen Students

1. **Create a Discuno profile** highlighting your goals, target schools, and questions.
2. **Book a “First-gen strategy session”** with a mentor who shares your background.
3. **Outline key deadlines** together (applications, housing, FAFSA, scholarship renewals).
4. **Schedule recurring check-ins** for accountability through senior year, orientation, and the first semester.
5. **Pay it forward:** Once you’re settled, become a mentor and guide the next first-gen student.
