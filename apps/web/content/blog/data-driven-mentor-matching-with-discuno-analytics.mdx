Great mentorship feels magical, but it’s the result of data-driven systems humming in the background. Discuno blends PostHog analytics, Drizzle ORM, and proprietary ranking logic to continuously improve mentor-mentee matches. Here’s how program directors can turn every session into actionable intelligence.

## The Challenge: Getting Matching Right at Scale

When mentorship cohorts grow past a handful of participants, manual matching breaks down:

- Profiles are incomplete or outdated.
- Demand spikes leave mentors overbooked while others sit idle.
- Payouts and availability updates live in disconnected systems.
- There’s no closed loop from session feedback back to matching logic.

Discuno solves each friction point with instrumentation and automation.

## Instrumenting the Mentorship Journey

Discuno tracks the full lifecycle—from application to follow-up—using PostHog and Drizzle-backed tables:

1. **Application intent:** Capture declared goals, industries, and skill gaps via onboarding forms.
2. **Scheduling behavior:** Analyze which mentors get the most clicks, which time slots convert, and where drop-offs happen.
3. **Session feedback:** Collect qualitative ratings and structured outcomes (e.g., “resume reviewed,” “mock interview completed”).
4. **Long-term engagement:** Map repeat bookings, program retention, and referrals back to the mentors who drove them.

Every event is tagged with cohort, institution, and program metadata so you can slice insights without exporting to spreadsheets.

## Ranking Algorithm Signals

Discuno’s ranking engine lives in `apps/web/src/server/ranking/`. It blends qualitative and quantitative inputs:

- **Availability fit:** Cal.com data verifies mentors can actually take the meeting.
- **Expertise alignment:** Tags and majors stored in Drizzle tables ensure mentors meet mentees’ stated goals.
- **Engagement score:** PostHog events contribute to a rolling score based on attendance, feedback ratings, and follow-up actions.
- **Equity balancing:** Weighting prevents the same “celebrity mentors” from receiving every request, distributing opportunities fairly.

You can adjust signal weightings per program by editing server-side configuration and redeploying through Turborepo pipelines.

## Feedback Loops That Improve Over Time

- **Automated nudges:** Cron jobs remind mentors to update expertise tags and availability when engagement drops.
- **Conversational insights:** Optional text analysis summarises mentee feedback to surface new tags or curriculum gaps.
- **A/B testing:** Use PostHog cohorts to experiment with different matching rules or onboarding flows, then roll out the winners globally.

## Dashboards That Matter

| Metric                      | Why It Matters                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Match time-to-first-session | Reveals onboarding friction           |
| Mentor utilization          | Shows supply/demand balance           |
| Session outcome score       | Highlights which mentors drive impact |
| Retention by cohort         | Measures long-term value              |

Export these metrics into Slide decks, CRM notes, or your data warehouse with Discuno’s scheduled exports.

## Action Plan for Program Leads

1. **Audit existing data:** Ensure mentor tags, bios, and availability are accurate. Discuno flags stale records for you.
2. **Set baseline KPIs:** Track match conversion, no-show rates, and satisfaction from day one.
3. **Instrument feedback forms:** Capture structured signals after every session—Discuno feeds them directly into the ranking model.
4. **Review insights weekly:** Use PostHog dashboards and Discuno’s admin analytics to tweak matching weightings and highlight coaching wins.
5. **Share the story:** Report improvements to executive sponsors with visual dashboards and testimonials sourced from the data.
